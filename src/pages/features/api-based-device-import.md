Connect your devices effortlessly using our API. 

Simply fill out a form to create an API key and get started. An API key will be generated and sent to you via email as a TXT file, along with detailed instructions. The script connects to the windows machine, collects WMI information, and automatically imports it into the Portal. For Mac and Linux machines, basic machine details will be imported.
