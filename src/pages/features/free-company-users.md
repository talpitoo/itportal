Optimize user management and licensing costs by granting customers appropriate access levels based on their needs.

Read Only Company Users are used to provide your clients or admin staff with read-only access to the information stored in the Portal. Read-only Company Users do not take up a license; hence you can create as many of these accounts as you want. When they log in, they only see their company.
