Customers need their data. Give them access as company users. Assign a license only if they need to change items.

Read Only Company Users are used to provide your clients or admin staff with read-only access to the information stored in the Portal. Read-only Company Users do not take up a license; hence you can create as many of these accounts as you want. When they log in, they only see their company.
