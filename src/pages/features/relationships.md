The true power of the Portal lies in its ability to visualize complex connections between your IT assets. Create relationship matrices to understand how objects interact within your environment.

- **Document dependencies**: Map service accounts to dependent services or devices, databases to referencing applications, and shared credentials to associated routers.
- **Visualize infrastructure**: Create image libraries of server rooms to relate and manage physical components.
- **Optimize software licensing**: Connect software agreements to licensed users for efficient management.

By visualizing these relationships, you can identify inefficiencies, optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven decisions to improve overall IT operations.
