## Password Management

- Record credential logins, subscription, and support accounts used by a particular company
- Apply credentials directly to objects like devices, wireless networks, databases, and any other object in the Portal
- Access those credentials via our browser plugin
- Password admins can review/export password lists
- Password admins report on access to all credentials in the Portal
- Share credentials with users
- Copy Credentials to the clipboard
- See above --> Documentations --> Accounts for example credentials

## My Password List

Give your users the ability to store their personal passwords. This password list is only accessible by the user. When first accessed, they must enter their encryption key. This key is never stored anywhere.

## Browser Password Plugin

The IT Portal Password Plug-in will allow you to find any shared and personal passwords from your IT Portal. It searches the Portal for the site you are on and recommends credentials to use for login. Use the plug-in to search for credentials without having to log in to the IT Portal.

Download it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/it-portal-password-lookup/dijocadohljfnagfjhpglffpmcodjpgn) and test it on our live demo site.
