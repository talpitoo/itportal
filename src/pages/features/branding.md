Basic Branding (Portal Standard)
Branding in the IT Portal has always allowed you to use your own domain name to access the portal. After setting up the branding, the portal logo will be replaced with your logo. The login page will also be customized to your branding settings. In the cloud, a company called CNH can use a name like portal.myMSP.com. By default, this URL will redirect to our secure site (Example https://myMSP.itportal.com) with your branding settings.

Advanced Branding (Portal Pro)
We understand that you do not want to see myMSP.itportal.com in the URL. Because of the complexity of the request, it will require many changes to our backend and support will be more difficult for us to maintain. That being said, we want to try to make this work for you. You must use a [Cloudflare](http://www.cloudflare.com/) plan starts at $20/Month. Cloudflare is required as we do not allow access to our web servers directly on the internet. Our web servers only respond to secure requests from Cloudflare. Reply to support@siportal.com for setup.
