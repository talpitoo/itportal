In most cases, we either have your consent or need the information to provide the service you've requested from us.

                                You can decline certain kinds of information use either by not providing the information in the first place or by opting out later. You can also disable cookies to prevent your browser from giving us information, but if you do so, certain website features may not work properly.

                                The European Economic Area (EEA) provides certain rights to data subjects (including access, rectification, erasure, restriction of processing, data portability, and the right to object and to complain). We undertake to provide you the same rights no matter where you choose to live.

                                We keep your personal information for as long as it is required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Policy. When we no longer have a legitimate need to process your information, we will delete, anonymize, or isolate your information, whichever is appropriate.

              <strong>Information that we process on your behalf</strong>
              <br><br>
                                If you handle other people's data using our apps, such as information about your customers or employees, you are entrusting that data to us for processing. If you use our mobile app and give the app access to your contacts and photo library, you are entrusting data to us. The data you entrust to us for processing is called service data.
                            </p>
            <p>
                                You own your service data. We protect it, limit access to it, and only process it according to your instructions. You may access it, share it through third-party integrations, and request that we export or delete it.
                            </p>
            <p>
                                We hold the data in your account as long as you choose to use our Services. After you terminate your account, your data will be automatically deleted from our active database within 6 months and from our backups within 3 months after that.

            <p>
                                If you are in the European Economic Area and you believe that someone has entrusted your information to us for processing (for instance, your employer or a company whose services you use), you can request certain actions from us regarding your data. To exercise those data rights, please contact the person or company that entrusted the data to us and we will work with them on your request.
