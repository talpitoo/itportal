    <p class="">As IT Teams grow, they outgrow the cluttered file shares and excel password lists. They need a secure structured platform that allows for the easy access and sharing of information regarding their IT Infrastructure. Reduce downtime, creates accountability for documentation, and provides peace of mind for managers and IT professionals. Our partners say,  "I got this; It is in the Portal!." Can you?</p>

            <strong class="founderName">Alex Cabral</strong> is the CEO and founder of IT Portal Inc.<p></figcaption>
        </figure>
                            21+ years ago, while working as a Senior Systems Engineer at an integration firm in New York City, he struggled to keep his team informed about the inter-working of the client networks. At the time, IT firms primarily cared about and focused on time entry and proper project management. Alex worked with the developers that managed the time entry program to provide his team the information they needed to manage their customers. But the output of the engagement never met the expectations that Alex set. That is where having a background in development stepped in-he outlined precisely how the product should look. Unfortunately, the level of effort required of the dev team proved to be too much, and development stopped. Alex later moved to a new firm and realized that the chaos was not just at his previous firm-but it appeared that access to information seemed to be a problem everywhere. They at least had a spreadsheet with passwords, IP addresses, and client folders on a network share.
                        </p>

    <p>The IT Portal was born to serve as the documentation space for supporting customers and provides billable hours in project engagements. Engineers can go on vacation. IT Managers have confidence that existing employees make systems information available to new employees.</p>

    <p>The IT Portal is a product created from Alex's years of experience in the Systems Integration/MSP field, coupled with years of feedback from thousands of users. Alex's passion lies in making relevant information easily accessible to people that need to support their customers, finding it most rewarding when individuals see the value and power provided by an IT Portal.</p>

    <h3>Our Team</h3>

    <p>
                            Alex manages the development team and new business development. Jeremy manages the Help Desk and assists all of our customers during the initial setup. Jeremy worked primarily in Software Support giving him a lot of shared experiences with our clientele.  He understands the realities of working with poor documentation and is very enthusiastic about providing solid customer service and what we can provide to all MSPs from one-man shops to large companies.
                        </p>

    <h3> Our Infrastructure and your data </h3>

    <p>
                            We house our data in secure data centers that are hosted and managed in AWS. We have data centers hosting you cloud services in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Canada, and Australia.  All of our data is encrypted at rest using our encryption keys. Your data can also be encrypted using your encryption key at setup. When your files/passwords are encrypted, we do not have access. To provide a failsafe, we replicate data across data centers. We also offer you the Portal Export tool that you can use to sync your Cloud copy to a laptop.
