Save important files, images, and notes about your environment as documents and relate them to devices and other objects. Sample documents include build books, diagrams, checklists, DR documentation, policies, and procedures. A repository can have no attached files, one main attached file, or sets of folders with associated files.

## Key benefits:

- Improve efficiency by centralizing document storage
- Enhance collaboration through shared access
- Reduce risk of data loss with version control
- Streamline knowledge sharing and onboarding
