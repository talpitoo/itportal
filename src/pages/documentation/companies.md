If you are a MSP, you can view documentation on all the companies you support. IT Departments will see everything in thier one company. We allow you to create Sites (locations), Facilities (Buildings, Floors, Suites), Cabinets (Racks), and IP Networks to logically group resources and see them all in one place.
