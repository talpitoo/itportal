Create searchable knowledge base articles in the Portal. Use KBs for general how-to guides rating to the technologies in your infrastructure environment. KBs should not be confused with documents. Documents are for documenting completed work. For example, a script to install pre-requirements for a product can be in the KB. Showing the results of running the pre-requirements for a particular device should be kept under documents.
