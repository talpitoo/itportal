  - Optional Encryption key. Encrypt usernames and passwords with this key. Uploaded files will be encrypted as well using this same key. The default key will encrypt data if you do not have an optional key.
  - Built-in 2 Factor Authentication
  - Encryption at rest
  - Our web servers are not open to the Internet. Our web servers are only accessible by the CloudFlare CDN (Content Delivery Network). You transparently connect to CloudFlare, and they present you with your data. Also, note that CloudFlare handles 10% of the world's web traffic and is very secure.

  Protecting Australian government data from access, abuse and disclosure remains a prime consideration when procuring and leveraging cloud services. AWS recognises that customers rely upon the secure delivery of the AWS infrastructure and the importance of having features that enable the customer to create more secure environments. AWS enables customers to meet these objectives by prioritising security in the delivery of its services through the establishment of a robust control environment and making available for use a wide range of security services and features. These services provide comprehensive controls over the customer IT control environment, simplify the management of security services and provide improved security outcomes for the Australian Government.

  The Information Security Registered Assessors Program (IRAP) enables Australian government customers to validate that appropriate controls are in place and determine the appropriate responsibility model for addressing the needs of the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) Information Security Manual (ISM).
