##  Logging

Admins have a complete list of log options. You can run reports on:

- User Access
- Settings Access
- Successful and Failed. Authentication attempts into the Portal
- Access to Passwords. If the password policy (Settings --> Security --> Password Policy) dictates that users are required to state why they need these passwords, then those statements are recorded here as well.
- Changes to usernames and passwords, including who changed them, the old and new value
