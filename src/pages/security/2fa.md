The Portal provides a variety of two-factor authentication options.

- IT Portal One Time Password - We recommend using this when you do not want to enter your password as this option does not require your regular password. It will email you a one-time password and ask you to answer a security question.
- IT Portal Mobile App 2FA - We recommend using this as an alternative to Google Authenticator. Users can share their Google Authenticator 2FA QRcode. Our mobile app is tied to the user, ensuring they are the ones that are logging in.
- Google Authenticator
- AuthAnvil Authentication
- Duo Authentication via TOTP, SAML, or our native integration
- Radius Authentication
