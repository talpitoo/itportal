You may have scenarios where you would want to restrict access to the Portal. IP Access lists allow you to do just that. You can specify which IPs to allow or IPs to block. You can optionally enable one-time passwords or Google authenticator to bypass the IP access restrictions. So, for example, you can configure the Portal to disable two-factor authentication if used from your home office but require two-factor if used on the Internet.
