Allows control of who can access your organizationâ€™s portal with granular IP-based restrictions.

- **Targeted Security**: Allow or block access based on specific IP addresses or ranges, ensuring only authorized users can log in.
- **Flexible Authentication**: Bypass IP restrictions with strong two-factor authentication for added security and convenience.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce the risk of unauthorized access by limiting login attempts to trusted IP addresses.
- **Customized Policies**: Tailor access rules to your organization's specific needs, such as requiring two-factor authentication for external connections while allowing password-only logins from internal networks.
