Access control is robust and granular in the Portal.

- Set ACLs on a particular object, allowing networks admins access on a firewall
- Set ACLs on an entire company
- Set Global ACLs on an object type. For example, desktop admins are restricted from seeing firewalls
- Setup users to not have access to all passwords, then assign ACLs to give access

Old (2011) but relevant video on ACLs
