Take precise control over who can access and modify specific data within the Portal.

- **Object-Level Security**: Protect sensitive information by granting access to specific objects only to authorized users. For example, allow network admins to manage firewalls while restricting desktop admins from viewing them.
- **Company-Wide Control**: Manage access permissions at the company level, ensuring data security and compliance.
- **Global Access Restrictions**: Define broad access controls based on user roles or job functions, streamlining administration and reducing risk.
- **Password Management**: Securely manage password visibility by assigning granular access permissions to authorized individuals.
