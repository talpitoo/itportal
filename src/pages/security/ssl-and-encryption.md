## On-Premises or Cloud Flexibility

We understand that some customers prefer to manage their data on-premises, while others require cloud-based solutions. We offer both options to meet your specific needs.

- **Optional Encryption Key**: Add an extra layer of security by using a custom encryption key for usernames, passwords, and uploaded files.
- **Built-in 2-Factor Authentication**: Safeguard your account with strong two-factor verification.
- **Encryption at Rest**: Your data remains encrypted even when stored on our servers.
- **Secure Cloud Infrastructure**: Our cloud platform utilizes Cloudflare's Content Delivery Network (CDN) for enhanced security and performance. Cloudflare handles a significant portion of global web traffic, ensuring your data is protected by their robust infrastructure.
